# USB Annoy-o-tron

Turn your ESP32-S2 into an annoying mouse moving and keyboard pressing "toy"

## What is it?

Thinkgeek used to make a "Phantom Keystroker" that would randomly input
keys and mouse movements as a prank. Sadly the device is no longer being made.
Enter the ESP32-S2 with it's USB emulation mode. Now we can recreate the fun
of the original toy on a $2 micro-controller.
